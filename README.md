        <h3>Contributions to Society</h3>
        <p>
            Samantha’s crowning achievement? Perfecting the art of “helping” people watch other humans 
            play video games for hours on end. Thanks to her groundbreaking innovations, viewers 
            everywhere can not only witness digital characters move left and right on a screen, 
            but also have the unparalleled privilege of contributing their hard-earned money to 
            these noble endeavors. “Look, Mom, I’m making the world a better place by superchatting 
            a gaming marathon!” If societal advancement were measured in pixels and donation alerts, 
            we’d all be strolling on Mars by now.
